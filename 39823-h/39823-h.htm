PREFACE.
</p>


<p>
As nearly as we can learn, the only origin which has been suggested for
the devices combined in the national colors of our country is, that
they were adopted from the coat of arms of General Washington. This
imputed origin is not such as would be consonant with the known modesty
of Washington, or the spirit of the times in which the flag was
adopted. We have, therefore, been at some pains to collect authentic
statements in reference to our national colors, and with these, have
introduced letters exhibiting the temper of those times, step by step,
with the changes made in the flag, so combining them as to form a chain
of proof, which, we think, must be conclusive.
</p>

<p>
Should, however, the perusal of the following account of the origin and
meaning of the devices in the national flag of our country, serve no
other purpose than that of impressing more strongly upon the mind of
the reader the importance and the prominence those who achieved our
liberties and founded our government attached to the idea of Union, its
preparation will not have been a futile labor.
</p>

<p>
Emblems and devices, adopted under high excitement of the public mind,
are chosen as epitomes of the sentiments prevailing at the time of
their adoption. Those of the days of our Revolution afford proofs far
more striking than the most elaborate arguments, that, in the
estimation of our forefathers, Union, and existence as a nation, were
inseparable.
</p>

<p>
The prosecution of our subject has made it necessary for us to dwell
upon those devices, and to develop those proofs.
</p>

<p class="section">

INTRODUCTION.
</p>


<p>
As a not uninteresting introduction to our research, we will glance at
the history of standards, from their inception to the present time. We
shall find that man's faculty of imitation has here, as elsewhere,
found employment, modified in its operation by some cause peculiar to
the nation whose standard chances to be under consideration.
</p>

<p>
Fosbroke, in his <i>Dictionary of Antiquities</i>, has furnished us
with most of the information on this subject which is pertinent to our
design. We shall add such comments as will tend to illustrate our
conclusions. Under the head of standards, he writes:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The invention began among the Egyptians, who bore an animal at the end
of a spear; but among the Gr&#230;co-Egyptians, the standards either
resemble, at top, a round-headed knife, or an expanded semicircular
fan. Among the earlier Greeks, it was a piece of armor at the end of a
spear; though Agamemnon, in Homer, uses a purple veil to rally his men,
&amp;c. Afterwards, the Athenians bore the olive and owl; the other nations
the effigies of their tutelary gods, or their particular symbols, at
the end of a spear. The Corinthians carried a <i>pegasus</i>, the
Messenians their initial &Mu;, and the Laced&#230;monians, &Lambda;; the
Persians, a golden eagle at the end of a spear, fixed upon a carriage;
the ancient Gauls, an animal, chiefly a bull, lion, and bear. Sir S. R.
Meyrick gives the following account of the Roman standards. 'Each
<i>century</i>, or at least each <i>maniple</i> of troops, had its
proper standard, and standard-bearer. This was originally merely a
bundle of hay on the top of a pole; afterwards, a spear with a
crosspiece of wood on the top; sometimes the figure of a hand above,
probably in allusion to the word <i>manipulus</i>; and below, a small
round or oval shield, generally of silver or of gold. On this metal
plate were anciently represented the warlike deities Mars or Minerva;
but after the extinction of the commonwealth, the effigies of the
emperors or their favorites. It was on this account that the standards
were called <i>numina legionum</i>, and held in religious veneration.
The standards of different divisions had certain letters inscribed on
them, to distinguish the one from the other. The standard of a legion,
according to Dio, was a silver eagle, with expanded wings, on the top
of a spear, sometimes holding a thunderbolt in its claws; hence the
word <i>aquila</i> was used to signify a legion. The place for this
standard was near the general, almost in the centre. Before the time of
Marius, figures of other animals were used, and it was then carried in
front of the first maniple of the <i>triarii</i>. The <i>vexillum</i>,
or flag of the cavalry (that of the infantry being called
<i>signum</i>; an eagle on a thunderbolt, within a wreath, in Meyrick,
pl. 6, fig. 15), was, according to Livy, a square piece of cloth, fixed
to a crossbar on the end of a spear. The <i>labarum</i>, borrowed by
the Greek emperors from the Celtic tribes, by whom it was called
<i>llab</i>, was similar to this, but with the monogram of Christ
worked upon it. Thus Sir S. R. Meyrick. The dragon, which served for an
ensign to barbarous nations, was adopted by the Romans, probably from
the mixture of auxiliaries with the legions. At first, the dragon, as
the general ensign of the barbarians, was used as a trophy by the
Romans, after Trajan's conquest of the Dacians. The dragons were
embroidered in cotton, or silk and purple. The head was of metal, and
they were fastened on the tops of spears, gilt and tasselled, opening
the mouth wide, which made their long tails, painted with different
colors, float in the wind. They are seen on the Trajan column and the
arch of Titus, and are engraved. The <i>draconarii</i>, or ensigns, who
carried them, were distinguished by a gold collar. From the Romans,
says Du Cange, it came to the Western Empire, and was long, in England,
the chief standard of our kings, and of the dukes of Normandy. Matthew
Paris notes its being borne in wars which portended destruction to the
enemy. It was pitched near the royal tent, on the right of the other
standards, where the guard was kept. Stowe adds, that the
dragon-standard was never used but when it was an absolute intention to
fight; and a golden dragon was fixed, that the weary and wounded might
repair thither, as to a castle, or place of the greatest security. Thus
far for the dragon-standard. To return, Vigetius mentions <i>pinn&#230;</i>,
perhaps <i>aigrettes</i> of feathers, of different colors, intended for
signals, rallying-points, &amp;c. Animals, fixed upon plinths, with holes
through them, are often found. They were ensigns intended to be placed
upon the ends of spears.
</p>

<p>
"Count Caylus has published several; among others two leopards, male
and female. Ensigns upon colonial coins, if accompanied with the name
of the legion, <i>but not otherwise</i>, show that the colony was
founded by the veterans of that legion. There were also standards
called <i>pila</i>, or <i>tufa</i>, consisting of bucklers heaped one
above the other.
</p>

<p>
"The ancient Franks bore the tiger, wolf, &amp;c., but soon adopted the
eagle from the Romans. In the second race, they used the cross, images
of saints, &amp;c. The <i>fleur-de-lis</i> was the distinctive attribute of
the king.
</p>

<p>
"Ossian mentions the standard of the kings and chiefs of clans, and
says that it (the king's) was blue studded with gold. This is not
improbable, for the Anglo-Saxon ensign was very grand. It had on it
<i>the white horse</i>, as the Danish was distinguished by the
<i>raven</i>. They were, however, differently formed from the modern,
being parallelograms, fringed, and borne, sometimes at least, upon a
stand with four wheels. A standard upon a car was, we have already
seen, usual with the ancient Persians. Sir S. R. Meyrick admits that it
was of Asiatic origin, first adopted by the Italians, and introduced
here in the reign of Stephen. That of Stephen is fixed by the middle
upon a staff, topped by a cross <i>patt&#233;e</i> (wider at the ends than
in the middle), has a cross <i>patt&#233;e</i> itself on one wing, and three
small branches shooting out from each flag. It appears from Drayton,
that the main standard of Henry V. at the battle of Agincourt was borne
upon a car; and the reason which he assigns is, that it was too heavy
to be carried otherwise. Sir S. R. Meyrick adds, that it preceded the
royal presence. Edward I. had the arms of England, St. George, St.
Edmond, and St. Edward, on his standards. The flag or banner in the
hands of princes, upon seals, denotes sovereign power, and was assumed
by many lords in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries."
</p>

<p>
We observe that the invention of standards is ascribed to the
Egyptians. Layard, in "Nineveh, and its Remains," says of the standards
of the Assyrians:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Standards were carried by the charioteers. In the sculptures, they
have only two devices: one, a figure (probably that of the divinity)
standing on a bull, and drawing a bow; the other, two bulls running in
opposite directions," probably, as is stated in a note, the symbols of
war and peace.
</p>

<p>
"These figures are inclosed in a circle, and fixed to the end of a long
staff ornamented with streamers and tassels." Here we see the early use
of pendants as emblems of supreme authority. In our own day, we
frequently hear, Commodore &mdash;&mdash;'s broad pendant was hoisted on the ship
&mdash;&mdash;. In Queen Anne's time, on the union of England and Scotland, we
find the use of pendants by the ships of her subjects, expressly
prohibited in the following words: "<i>Nor any kind of pendants
whatsoever</i>, or any other ensign than the ensign described in the
side or margent hereof, which shall be worn instead of the ensign
before this time [1707] usually worn in merchant vessels." In reference
to the flags of the national vessels, the following language is used:
"Our flags, jacks, and pendants, which, <i>according to ancient
usage</i>, have been appointed to a distinction for our ships." Every
one will observe the distinction made in the case of the pendants,
which were absolutely prohibited to the subjects. We return now to the
consideration of the standards of the Assyrians. "The standards seem to
have been partly supported by a rest in front of the chariot, and a
long rod or rope connected them with the extremity of the pole. In a
bas-relief of Khorsabad, this rod is attached to the top of the
standard."<a href="#note1" name="noteref1" class="fnanchor"><small>[1]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The reader will have observed what Fosbroke says of the introduction
into England of a standard borne on a car, that it was in imitation of
the eastern nations. In the case of the Romans, the force of this habit
was even more strikingly illustrated. They at first used a bundle of
bay or straw; as they extended their conquests over the neighboring
colonists from Greece, and doubtless from Egypt, they assumed the wolf
and other animals. The wolf, perhaps, referred to the foster-mother of
Romulus. As they extended their conquests further, they borrowed the
custom of the Greeks, of placing a shield with the image of a warlike
deity upon it on a spear, still, however, retaining the reference to
the <i>manipulus</i> in the hand, above it.
</p>

<p>
In the time of Marius, they adopted the eagle with the thunderbolt in
its claws, the emblem of Jove. We are also told that different
divisions had certain letters, frequently the name of the commander,
inscribed on their standards. This practice was also introduced among
the Romans from Greece. It was introduced among the Grecians by
Alexander the Great, who observed it among the Persians and other
eastern nations. Intoxicated with his triumphs, when he began to claim
for himself a divine origin, he caused a standard to be prepared,
inscribed with the title of "Son of Ammon," and planted it near the
image of Hercules, which, as that of his tutelary deity, was the ensign
of the Grecian host. In the same way, the Franks borrowed the eagle
from the Romans.
</p>

<p>
The same holds good of the dragon-standard, which, borrowed from the
Dacians and other barbarians, was for a long time the standard of the
Western Empire, of England, and of Normandy.
</p>

<p>
After the Crusades, however, the cross seems to have taken a prominent
place on the standards and banners of European nations.
</p>

<p>
The double-headed eagle of Russia and Austria originated among the
Romans, to indicate the sovereignty of the world. When the empire of
the C&#230;sars was divided into the Western and Eastern Empires, this
standard continued to be used in both those divisions. From the Eastern
Empire it passed into the standard of Russia, on the marriage of Ivan
I. with a Grecian princess. From the Western, with the title of Roman
Emperor, it passed to Austria.
</p>

<p>
From the above, we cannot fail to perceive, in the past as well as in
the present, the tendency, throughout the world, to imitation, in the
adoption of national ensigns; also, that the adoption of a particular
ensign marked some epoch in the history of the particular nation which
adopted it.
</p>

<p>
Thus the various changes in the Roman standard marked the epochs of
their conquest, first of the Greeks, then of the Barbarians. The
adoption of the eagle by the Franks, their conquest of the Romans. The
cross, the era of the Crusades. The double-headed eagle of Russia, the
marriage of the Czar to the heiress of the Eastern Empire. That of
Austria, the investiture of the emperors of Germany with the title of
Roman Emperor. The present union of the crosses of St. George, St.
Andrew, and St. Patrick, in the British ensign, reverting to the
Crusades, in the members composing it, more directly refers to the
union, first, of England and Scotland into the united kingdom of Great
Britain, and more recently, to the union of the kingdoms of Great
Britain and Ireland, and hence is called <i>The Great Union</i>.
</p>

<p>
The eagle of France, marked her republican era.
</p>

<p>
Having thus observed, in the adoption of ensigns by the principal
nations of the world, the prevalence of certain general rules, viz.: A
reference to their deity; the habit of imitating the ensigns of nations
from which they sprung, or which they conquered; the custom of marking,
by their standards, some epoch in their history; or these customs in
combination, may we not expect to find, in the adoption of our National
Ensign, that it is not wholly an exception to these general rules?
</p>

<hr class="med">

<p class="main">
THE NATIONAL FLAG
<br>
OF THE
<br>
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
</p>


<p>
Adopting these general principles, we find ourselves, in attempting to
give a satisfactory account of the origin, adoption, and meaning of the
devices embodied in the National Flag of the United States, obliged to
describe the principal flags displayed during the Revolution, which
resulted in the independence of those States; to give some account of
the flags used by the colonists prior to that Revolution; and to
notice, though in a cursory manner, the national flag of the mother
country.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate the consideration of our subject, we shall arrange the
flags, mention of which we have met with, as displayed during our
Revolution, in a table, chronologically; and shall number them,
according to the date of the notice of them, 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., beginning
in 1774.
</p>

<p>
In this Table, we shall give their distinguishing devices; noticing
them, when necessary, more at length as we proceed.
</p>

<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ctr">
TABLE OF THE ABOVE FLAGS.
</p>

<p>
1. "Union Flags."<a href="#note2" name="noteref2" class="fnanchor"><small>[2]</small></a>&mdash;These flags are very frequently mentioned in the
newspapers, in 1774, but no account is given of the devices upon them.
To establish these devices, will be one of the principal objects of
this inquiry.
</p>

<p>
2. The standard of the Connecticut troops.&mdash;A letter, dated
Wethersfield, Connecticut, April 23, 1775, says: "We fix upon our
standards and drums the colony arms, with the motto, '<i>Qui transtulit
sustinet</i>,' round it, in letters of gold, which we construe thus:
'God, who transplanted us hither, will support us.'"<a href="#note3" name="noteref3" class="fnanchor"><small>[3]</small></a> The standards
of the different regiments were distinguished by their color. Act of
Provincial Congress of Connecticut, July 1, 1775: "One standard for
each regiment <i>to be distinguished by their color, as follows, viz.:
for the seventh, blue; for the eighth, orange</i>."<a href="#note4" name="noteref4" class="fnanchor"><small>[4]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
3. The flag unfurled by General Israel Putnam, on Prospect Hill, July
18, 1775, which is thus described in a letter, dated
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ralign">
    "<span class="sc">Cambridge</span>, July 21, 1775.
</p>

<p>
    "Last Saturday, July 15, the several regiments quartered in this
    town being assembled upon the parade, the Rev. Dr. Langdon,
    President of the College, read to them 'A Declaration, by the
    Representatives of the United Colonies of North America now met in
    General Congress at Philadelphia, setting forth the causes and
    necessity of taking up arms.' It was received with great applause;
    and the approbation of the army, with that of a great number of
    other people, was immediately announced by three huzzas. His
    Excellency, the General, with several other general officers, &amp;c.,
    were present on the occasion."
</p>

<p>
    "Last Tuesday morning, July 18, according to orders issued the day
    before by Major-General Putnam, all the continental troops under
    his immediate command assembled at Prospect Hill, when the
    Declaration of the Continental Congress was read; after which, an
    animated and pathetic address to the army was made by the Rev. Mr.
    Leonard, chaplain to General Putnam's regiment, and succeeded by a
    pertinent prayer, when General Putnam gave the signal, and the
    whole army shouted their loud <i>amen</i> by three cheers;
    immediately upon which a cannon was fired from the fort, and the
    standard lately sent to General Putnam was exhibited, flourishing
    in the air, bearing this motto; on one side, 'An Appeal to Heaven,'
    and, on the other side, '<i>Qui transtulit sustinet</i>.'
</p>

<p>
    "The whole was conducted with the utmost decency, good order, and
    regularity, and the universal acceptance of all present; and the
    <i>Philistines</i>, on Bunker's Hill, heard the shout of the
    <i>Israelites</i>,<a href="#note5" name="noteref5" class="fnanchor"><small>[5]</small></a> and, being very fearful, paraded themselves
    in battle array."<a href="#note6" name="noteref6" class="fnanchor"><small>[6]</small></a>
</p>
</div>
<p>
This flag bore on it the motto of Connecticut, "<i>Qui transtulit
sustinet</i>," and the motto, "An Appeal to Heaven;" the latter of
which is evidently adopted from the closing paragraph of the "Address
of the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, to their brethren in Great
Britain," written shortly after the battle of Lexington, which ended
thus: 'Appealing to Heaven for the justice of our cause, we determine
to die or be free;' and which motto, under the form 'Appeal to Heaven,'
combined with a pine-tree, constituted the motto and device on the
colors of the Massachusetts colonial cruisers. In this combination of
the mottoes of Connecticut and Massachusetts, one can scarcely fail to
perceive the germ of the emblem of union which was introduced into the
flag, which, January 2, 1776, replaced the flag we have described
above, on Prospect Hill.
</p>

<p>
From the following notice of the flag displayed by General Putnam, July
18, 1775, we learn that it was a red flag. Before, however, giving the
notice, we will state that, as early as the time of the Romans, a red
flag was the signal of defiance or battle; thus, we are told: "When a
general, after having consulted the auspices, had determined to lead
forth his troops against the enemy, a red flag was displayed on a spear
from the top of the <i>Pr&#230;torium</i>,<a href="#note7" name="noteref7" class="fnanchor"><small>[7]</small></a> which was the signal to
prepare for battle."<a href="#note8" name="noteref8" class="fnanchor"><small>[8]</small></a> This accords with the account given of the
display of the above flag, and corroborates the fact mentioned in the
following extract from a letter of a captain of an English transport to
his owners in London:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ralign">
    "<span class="sc">Boston</span>, Jan. 17, 1776.
</p>

<p>
    "I can see the rebels' camp very plain, whose colors, a little
    while ago, were entirely red; but, on the receipt of the king's
    speech (which they burnt), they have hoisted the Union Flag, which
    is here supposed to intimate the union of the provinces."<a href="#note9" name="noteref9" class="fnanchor"><small>[9]</small></a>
</p>
</div>
<p>
He probably could not perceive the mottoes referred to in the preceding
letter, owing to the distance.

4. The flag used at the taking of Fort Johnston, on James's Island,
September 13, 1775.&mdash;"Colonel Moultrie, September 13 [1775], received
an order from the Council of Safety for taking Fort Johnston, on
James's Island." [S.C.] "A flag being thought necessary for the
purpose of signals, Colonel Moultrie, who was requested by the Council
of Safety to procure one, had a large blue flag made, with a crescent
in one corner, to be in uniform with the troops. This was the first
American flag displayed in South Carolina."<a href="#note10" name="noteref10" class="fnanchor"><small>[10]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Of the crescent, we have the following interesting account:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"As is well known, the crescent, or, as it is usually designated, the
<i>crescent montant</i>, has become the symbol of the Turkish Empire,
which has thence been frequently styled the Empire of the Crescent.
This symbol, however, did not originate with the Turks. Long before
their conquest of Constantinople, the crescent had been used <i>as
emblematic of sovereignty</i>, as may be seen from the still-existing
medals struck in honor of Augustus, Trajan, and others; and it formed
from all antiquity the symbol of Byzantium. On the overthrow of this
empire by Mohammed II., the Turks, regarding the crescent, which
everywhere met their eye, as a good omen, adopted it as their chief
bearing."<a href="#note11" name="noteref11" class="fnanchor"><small>[11]</small></a> It was, doubtless, "as the emblem of sovereignty," that it
was adopted by Colonel Moultrie.
</p>

<p>
5. The flag of the floating batteries.&mdash;Colonel Joseph Reed to Colonel
Glover and Stephen Moylan, says: "Head-quarters, October 20, 1775:
Please to fix upon some particular color for a flag, and a signal by
which our vessels may know one another. What do you think of a flag
with a white ground, a tree in the middle, the motto, 'Appeal to
Heaven?' This is the flag of our floating batteries."<a href="#note12" name="noteref12" class="fnanchor"><small>[12]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
6. The flag called <i>The Great Union Flag</i>, hoisted January 2,
1776, the day which gave being to the new army.&mdash;General Washington's
letter of January 4, 1776, to Joseph Reed.<a href="#note13" name="noteref13" class="fnanchor"><small>[13]</small></a> This flag, which we shall
designate in this way, was the basis of our National Flag of the
present day.
</p>

<p>
7. The flag presented by Colonel Gadsden, a member of the Naval
Committee of the Continental Congress, to the Provincial Congress of
South Carolina, February 9, 1776, as the standard to be used by the
Commander-in-chief of the American Navy, "being a yellow field, with a
lively representation of a rattlesnake in the middle, in the attitude
of going to strike; and the words underneath, Don't tread on me."<a href="#note14" name="noteref14" class="fnanchor"><small>[14]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
8. The flag of the cruisers of the colony of Massachusetts.&mdash;"And the
colors to be a white flag with a green pine-tree, and an inscription,
'Appeal to Heaven.'"&mdash;Resolution of Massachusetts Provincial Congress,
April 29, 1776.<a href="#note15" name="noteref15" class="fnanchor"><small>[15]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
9. The National Flag of the United States, "The Stars and Stripes,"
adopted as such by a Resolution of Congress, passed June 14,
1777.&mdash;"<i>Resolved</i>, That the flag of the Thirteen United States be
thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen
stars, white, in a blue field, representing a new constellation."<a href="#note16" name="noteref16" class="fnanchor"><small>[16]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
This Resolution, though passed June 14, 1777, was not made public until
September 3, 1777.<a href="#note17" name="noteref17" class="fnanchor"><small>[17]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
With this Table before us, we shall proceed to consider certain badges
intimately connected with the devices on the national flag of England,
afterwards embodied in the national flag of Great Britain, a
modification of which we shall show was, for a time, the flag of the
United States, and the basis of the "Stars and Stripes."
</p>

<p>
"In the first crusade, the Scots, according to Sir George Mackenzie,
were distinguished by the Cross of St. Andrew; the French, by a white
cross; and the Italians, by a blue one. The Spaniards, according to
Columbiere, bore a red cross, which, in the third crusade (<span class="smc">A.D.</span>
1189), was appropriated by the French, the Flemings using a
green cross, and the English a white one. The adherents of Simon
Montfort, the rebellious earl of Leicester, assumed the latter as their
distinguishing mark, thus making the national cognizance the badge of a
faction.

<p>
"The cross of St. George has been the badge, both of our kings and the
nation, at least from the time of Edward III. Its use was for a while
nearly superseded by the roses, but revived upon the termination of the
wars between the rival houses. It still continues to adorn the banner
of England."<a href="#note18" name="noteref18" class="fnanchor"><small>[18]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Of the arms and banner of St. George, we have the following account:
"Saynte George, whyche had whyte arms with a red cross." (Fig. 1, Plate
I.)
</p>

<p>
"This blessed and holy martyr Saynte George is patrone of the realme of
England; and ye crye of men of warre."<a href="#note19" name="noteref19" class="fnanchor"><small>[19]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"With reference to the cross of St. George, Sir N. H. Nicholas
observes: 'That in the fourteenth and subsequent centuries, even if the
custom did not prevail at a much earlier period, every English soldier
was distinguished by wearing that simple and elegant badge over his
armor.'
</p>

<p>
"The following extract," he adds, "from the ordinances made for the
government of the army with which Richard II. invaded Scotland in 1386,
and which were also adopted by Henry V., will best show the regulations
on the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Also, that everi man of what estate, condition, or nation thei be of,
so that he be of oure partie, bere a signe of the armes of Saint
George, large, both before and behynde, upon parell that yf he be
slayne or wounded to deth, he that hath so done to him shall not be put
to deth, for default of the cross that he lacketh. And that non enemy
do bere the same token or cross of St. George, notwithstanding if he be
prisoner, upon payne of deth."
</p>

<p>
"The banner of St. George is white, charged with the red cross."<a href="#note20" name="noteref20" class="fnanchor"><small>[20]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"Banner. A banner is a square flag painted or embroidered with arms,
and of a size proportioned to the rank of the bearer."<a href="#note21" name="noteref21" class="fnanchor"><small>[21]</small></a>&mdash;See the
Banner of St. George, Fig. 2, Plate I.
</p>

<p>
We now come to the description of the arms and banner of Saint Andrew.
The cross of St. Andrew is called a saltire, and is thus described:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Saltire, or <i>saltier</i>. This honorable ordinary probably
represents the cross whereon St. Andrew was crucified."<a href="#note22" name="noteref22" class="fnanchor"><small>[22]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"Andrew, S., the Apostle: the patron saint of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
"The arms attributed to him, and emblazoned on the banner bearing his
name, are azure, a saltire argent."<a href="#note23" name="noteref23" class="fnanchor"><small>[23]</small></a>&mdash;See Fig. 3, Plate I., Arms of
Saint Andrew; and for the banner of Saint Andrew, Fig. 4, Plate I.
</p>

<p>
"Union Jack: the national flag of Great Britain and Ireland.
</p>

<p>
"The ancient national flag of England was the banner of St. George
(argent, a cross gules), to which the banner of St. Andrew (azure, a
saltire argent), was united (instead of being quartered, according to
ancient custom), in pursuance of a royal proclamation, dated April 12,
1606. An extract from this proclamation follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Whereas, some difference hath arisen between our subjects of South and
North Britain, travelling by seas, about the bearing of their flags:
for the avoiding of all such contentions hereafter, we have, with the
advice of our council, ordered, that henceforth all our subjects of
this Isle and kingdom of Great Britain, and the members thereof, shall
bear in their maintop the red cross, commonly called St. George's
Cross, and the white cross, commonly called St. Andrew's Cross, joined
together, according to a form made by our heralds, and sent by us to
our admiral, to be published to our said subjects; and in their foretop
our subjects of South Britain shall wear the red cross only, as they
were wont; and the subjects of North Britain, in their foretop, the
white cross only, as they were accustomed."<a href="#note24" name="noteref24" class="fnanchor"><small>[24]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The union of the crosses described above may naturally be called the
<i>king's colors</i>, though in fact, as James was king both of
Scotland and England, the national flags of either of those kingdoms
would also be the king's colors, in an extended sense; but would be
likely to be designated as the red or white crosses, or the crosses of
St. George or St. Andrew, while this form prepared by the heralds, and
only prescribed for "subjects travelling by seas," would be by those
subjects called, <i>par excellence</i>, the king's colors.
</p>

<p>
"There is," says Sir N. H. Nicholas, "every reason to believe that the
flag arranged by the heralds on this occasion was the same as, on the
union with Scotland [1707], became the national banner." It may be
emblazoned azure, a saltire argent surmounted by a cross gules, edged
of the second. (See Fig. 5, Plate I.) The white edging was no doubt
intended to prevent one color from being placed upon another; but this
precaution was, to say the least, unnecessary; for surely no heraldic
rule would have been broken, if the red cross had been placed upon the
white satire. The contact of the red cross and blue field would have
been authorized by numerous precedents. This combination was
constituted the national flag of Great Britain by a royal proclamation,
issued July 28, 1707.<a href="#note25" name="noteref25" class="fnanchor"><small>[25]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"No further change was made until the union with Ireland, January 1,
1801, previous to which instructions were given to combine the banner
of St. Patrick (argent, a saltire gules) with the crosses of St. George
and St. Andrew. In obedience to these instructions, the present
National Flag of Great Britain and Ireland was produced."<a href="#note26" name="noteref26" class="fnanchor"><small>[26]</small></a>&mdash;See Fig.
6, Plate I.
</p>

<p>
We would observe that, as this last form of the <i>union</i> was only
adopted in 1801, which was the first time that a change was made in the
flags proscribed in 1707, it is only of interest as completing the
account of the Union Jack.
</p>

<p>
"The word Jack is most probably derived from the surcoat, charged with
a red cross, anciently used by the English soldiery. This appears to
have been called a jacque, whence the word jacket, anciently written
jacquit."<a href="#note27" name="noteref27" class="fnanchor"><small>[27]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
We desire to impress this last remark upon the mind of the reader, as,
in the course of our inquiry, we shall meet more than once with
allusions to the "Jack," the "St. George's Jack," &amp;c., and to invite
special attention to the fact that the badge on the clothes of the
soldiery furnished a badge to the flag of their country. Thus the cross
of St. Andrew, worn by the Scots, was emblazoned on the banner of
Scotland, and the cross of St. George, worn by the English soldiery,
was emblazoned on the banner of England.
</p>

<p>
This last, the national flag of England, the Red Cross flag, has now,
for us, especial interest.
</p>

<p>
A singular circumstance furnishes us with proof that this Red Cross
flag was in use in the colonies. We find in the "Journal of John
Winthrop, Esq., the first governor of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay,"
the following memoranda in reference to it:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Anno 1634, November 5.] At the Court of Assistants, complaint was made
by one of the country (viz., Richard Brown, of Watertown, in the name
of the rest), that the ensign at Salem was defaced, viz.: one part of
the red cross taken out. Upon this, an attachment was issued against
Richard Davenport, ensign-bearer, to appear at the next court to
answer. Much matter was made of this, as fearing it would be taken as
an act of rebellion, or of like high nature, in defacing the king's
colors;" [<i>i.e.</i> the Banner of St. George;] "though the truth
were, it was done upon this opinion, that the red cross was given to
the King of England, by the pope, as an ensign of victory, and so a
superstitious thing, and a relic of antichrist. What proceeding was
hereupon, will appear after, at next court in the first month; for by
reason of the great snows and frosts, we used not to keep courts in the
three winter months."<a href="#note28" name="noteref28" class="fnanchor"><small>[28]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"Anno 1685, mo. 1, 4.] A General Court at Newtown."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Endecott was called to answer for defacing the cross in the
ensign; but, because the court could not agree about the thing, whether
the ensigns should be laid by, in regard that many refused to follow
them, the whole case was deferred till the next general court; and the
commissioners for military affairs gave order, in the mean time, that
all ensigns should be laid aside," &amp;c.<a href="#note29" name="noteref29" class="fnanchor"><small>[29]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"Anno 1685, mo. 3, 6.] A General Court was held at Newtown, where John
Haynes, Esq., was chosen governor; Richard Bellingham, Esq., deputy
governor; and Mr. Hough, and Mr. Dummer, chosen assistants to the
former; and Mr. Ludlow, the late deputy, left out of the magistracy.
The reason was, partly, because the people would exercise their
absolute power, &amp;c., and partly by some speeches of the deputy, who
protested against the election of the governor as void, for that the
deputies of the several towns had agreed upon the election before they
came, &amp;c. But this was generally discussed, and the election adjudged
good."<a href="#note30" name="noteref30" class="fnanchor"><small>[30]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Endecott was also left out, and called into question about the
defacing the cross in the ensign; and a committee was chosen, viz.:
every town chose one (which yet were voted for by all the people), and
the magistrates chose four, who, taking the charge to consider the
offence, and the censure due to it, and to certify the court, after one
or two hours time, made report to the court, that they found the
offence to be great, viz.: rash and without discretion, taking upon him
more authority than he had, and not seeking advice of the court, &amp;c.;
uncharitable, in that he, judging the cross, &amp;c., to be a sin, did
content himself to have reformed it at Salem, not taking care that
others might be brought out of it also; laying a blemish, also, upon
the rest of the magistrates, as if they would suffer idolatry, &amp;c., and
giving occasion to the state of England to think ill of us. For which
they adjudged him worthy admonition, and to be disabled for one year
from bearing any public office; declining any heavier sentence because
they were persuaded he did it out of tenderness of conscience, and not
of evil intent."<a href="#note31" name="noteref31" class="fnanchor"><small>[31]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"The matter of altering the cross in the ensign was referred to the
next meeting (the court having adjourned for three weeks), it being
propounded to turn it to the red and white rose, &amp;c."
</p>

<p>
[We have seen, under our first notice of the Cross of St. George, that
"its use was, for a while, nearly superseded (in England) by the roses,
but revived upon the termination of the wars between the rival
houses."] "And every man was to deal with his neighbors to still their
minds, who stood so stiff for the cross, until we should fully agree
about it, which was expected, because the ministers had promised to
take pains about it, and to write into England to have the judgment of
the most wise and godly there."<a href="#note32" name="noteref32" class="fnanchor"><small>[32]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"Anno 1635, mo. 12, 1.] At the last General Court it was referred to
the military commissioners to appoint colors for every company; who did
accordingly, and left out the cross in all of them, appointing the
king's arms to be put into that of Castle Island, and Boston to be the
first company."<a href="#note33" name="noteref33" class="fnanchor"><small>[33]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"Anno 1636, mo. 8, 15.] Here arrived a ship called the St. Patrick,
belonging to Sir Thomas Wentworth [afterwards the great Earl of
Strafford], deputy of Ireland [<i>i.e.</i> viceroy], one Palmer,
master. When she came near Castle Island, the lieutenant of the fort
went aboard her and made her strike her flag, which the master took as
a great injury, and complained of it to the magistrates, who, calling
the lieutenant before them, heard the cause and declared to the master
that he had no commission so to do. And because he had made them strike
to the fort (which had then no color abroad), they tendered the master
such satisfaction as he desired, which was only this, that the
lieutenant, aboard their ship, should acknowledge his error, that so
all the ship's company might receive satisfaction, lest the lord deputy
should have been informed that we had offered that discourtesy to his
ship which we had never offered to any before."
</p>

<p>
"Mo. 8, 31.] One Miller, master's mate in the Hector, spake to some of
our people aboard his ship, that, because we had not the king's colors
at our fort, we were all traitors and rebels, &amp;c. The governor sent for
the master, Mr. Ferne, and acquainted him with it, who promised to
deliver him to us. Whereupon, we sent the marshal and four sergeants to
the ship for him, but the master not being aboard they would not
deliver him; whereupon, the master went himself and brought him to the
court; and, the words being proved against him by two witnesses, he was
committed. The next day the master, to pacify his men, who were in a
great tumult, requested he might be delivered to him, and did undertake
to bring him before us again the day after, which was granted him, and
he brought him to us at the time appointed. Then, in the presence of
all the rest of the masters, he acknowledged his offence, and set his
hand to a submission, and was discharged."
</p>

<p>
We will break the thread of this extract to introduce this curious
paper, which, taken from the <i>Colonial Record,</i> i. 179, we, find
given at length in a note to Winthrop's <i>New England</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Whereas I, Thomas Millerd, have given out most false and reproachful
speeches against his majesty's loyal and faithful subjects, dwelling in
the Massachusetts Bay in America, saying that they were all traitors
and rebels, and that I would affirm so much before the governor
himself, which expressions I do confess (and so desire may be
conceived) did proceed from the rashness and distemper of my own brain,
without any just ground or cause so to think or speak, for which my
unworthy and sinful carriage being called in question, I do justly
stand committed. My humble request, therefore, is that, upon this my
full and ingenuous recantation of this my gross failing, it would
please the governor and the rest of the assistants to accept of this my
humble submission, to pass by my fault, and to dismiss me from further
trouble; and this, my free and voluntary confession, I subscribe with
my hand, this 9th June, 1686."
</p>

<p>
We now resume our extract from Winthrop.
</p>

<p>
"Then the governor desired the masters that they would deal freely, and
tell us, if they did take any offence, and what they required of us.
They answered, that in regard they should be examined upon their
return, what colors they saw here; they did desire that the king's
colors might be spread at our fort. It was answered, we had not the
king's colors. Thereupon, two of them did offer them freely to us."
This was about June, 1636, and we have seen that it was only in the
year 1635, that the commissioners for military affairs had ordered the
red cross ensigns to be laid aside; hence, it is altogether improbable
that they could not have procured one of these, but, what we have
styled the king's colors <i>par excellence</i>, being prescribed only
for ships, was not likely to be owned by the colonial authorities. Its
device, a modification of the cross, about which the question had
arisen, might possibly have served as a device to relieve the
tenderness of the consciences of the authorities, and would also enable
the masters to say, on their return, that they had seen the king's
colors spread at the castle at Boston.
</p>

<p>
As we see above, "it was answered we had not the king's colors.
Thereupon, two of them did offer them freely to us. We replied, that
for our part, we were fully persuaded that the cross in the ensign was
idolatrous, and, therefore, might not set it up in our ensign; but,
because the fort was the king's, and maintained in his name, we thought
his own colors might be spread there. So the governor accepted the
colors of Captain Palmer, and promised they should be set up at Castle
Island. We had conferred over night with Mr. Cotton, &amp;c., about the
point. The governor, and Mr. Dudley, and Mr. Cotton, were of opinion
that they might be set up at the fort upon this distinction, that it
was maintained in the king's name. Others, not being so persuaded,
answered that the governor and Mr. Dudley, being two of the council,
and being persuaded of the lawfulness, &amp;c., might use their power to
set them up. Some others being not so persuaded, could not join in the
act, yet would not oppose, as being doubtful, &amp;c."<a href="#note34" name="noteref34" class="fnanchor"><small>[34]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"Anno 1636, mo. 4, 16.] The governor, with consent of Mr. Dudley, gave
warrant to Lieutenant Morris, to spread the king's colors at Castle
Island, when the ships passed by. It was done at the request of the
masters of the ten ships which were then here; yet with this
protestation, that we held the cross in the ensign idolatrous, and,
therefore, might not set it up in our own ensigns; but this being kept
as the king's fort, the governor and some others were of opinion that
his own colors might be spread upon it. The colors were given us by
Captain Palmer, and the governor, in requital, sent him three
beaver-skins."<a href="#note35" name="noteref35" class="fnanchor"><small>[35]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The following order of the Court of Massachusetts, leads us to conclude
that these colors, or those containing the king's arms, were continued
in use until they were likely to bring the colony under the displeasure
of the Parliament of England, which, in arms against the king, used the
Red Cross flag, or St. George's banner. We then find the colony of
Massachusetts giving orders on this matter as follows:&mdash;

<p>
    "Forasmuch as the court conceives the old English colors now used
    by the Parliament of England to be a necessary badge of distinction
    betwixt the English and other nations in all places of the world,
    till the state of England shall alter the same, which we much
    desire, we being of the same nation, have, therefore, ordered that
    the captain of the castle shall presently advance the aforesaid
    colors of England upon the castle upon all necessary occasions."

times.

<p>
This question, and indeed all questions, as to the flags to be used
both at sea and land by the subjects of Great Britain, and the
dominions thereunto belonging, were, however, set at rest, by the 1st
article of the treaty of union between Scotland and England, from which
fact the flags then prescribed were called <i>Union flags</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Act of Parliament ratifying and approving the treaty of the two
kingdoms of Scotland and England, Jan. 16, 1707."
</p>

<p>
"I. Article. That the two kingdoms of Scotland and England shall, upon
the first day of May next, ensuing the date hereof, and forever after,
be united into one kingdom by the name of Great Britain; and that the
ensigns armorial of the said united kingdom be such as her majesty
shall appoint; and the crosses of St. Andrew and St. George be
conjoined in such manner as her majesty shall think fit, and used in
<i>all</i> flags, banners, standards, and ensigns, both at sea and
land."<a href="#note37" name="noteref37" class="fnanchor"><small>[37]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Under the head of Union Jack, we have shown how these crosses were
conjoined. We now give a portion of the proclamation of July 28, 1707,
referred to in that account of the Union Jack.

    and appoint the ensign described on the side or margent hereof [see
    Fig. 7, Plate I.], to be worn on board of all ships or vessels
    belonging to any of our subjects whatsoever; and to issue this, our
    royal proclamation, to notify the same to all our loving subjects,
    hereby strictly charging and commanding the masters of all merchant
    ships and vessels belonging to any of our subjects, whether
    employed in our service or otherwise, and all other persons whom it
    may concern, to wear the said ensign on board their ships and
    vessels. And whereas, divers of our subjects have presumed, on
    board their ships, to wear our flags, jacks, and pendants, which,
    according to ancient usage, have been appointed to a distinction
    for our ships, and many times thinking to avoid the punishment due
    for the same, have worn flags, jacks, and pendants in shape and
    mixture of colors, so little different from ours, as not without
    difficulty to be distinguished therefrom, which practice has been
    found attended with manifold inconveniences: for prevention of the
    same for the future, we do, therefore, with the advice of our privy
    council, hereby strictly charge and command all our subjects
    whatsoever, that they do not presume to wear on any of their ships
    or vessels, our jack, commonly called the Union Jack, nor any
    pendants, nor any such colors as are usually borne by our ships
    without particular warrant for their so doing from us, or our high
    admiral of Great Britain, or the commissioners for executing the
    office of high admiral for the time being; and do hereby further
    command all our loving subjects, that, without such warrant as
    aforesaid, they presume not to wear on board their ships or
    vessels, any flags, jacks, pendants, or colors, made in imitation
    of ours, or any kind of pendant, whatsoever, or any other ensign,
    than the ensign described in the side or margent hereof, which
    shall be worn instead of the ensign before this time usually worn
    in merchant vessels. Saving that, for the better distinction of
    such ships as shall have commissions of letters of mart or
    reprisals against the enemy, and any other ships or vessels which
    may be employed by principal officers and commissioners of our
    navy, the principal officers of our ordnance, the commissioners for
    victualling our navy, the commissioners for our customs, and the
    commissioners for transportation for our service&mdash;relating
    particularly to those offices our royal will and pleasure is, That
    all such ships as have commissions of letters of mart and
    reprisals, shall, besides the colors or ensign hereby appointed to
    be worn by merchant ships, wear a red jack, with a Union Jack
    described in a canton at the upper corner thereof, next the staff
    [see Fig. 1, Plate II.], and that such ships and vessels as shall
    be employed for our service by the principal officers and
    commissioners of our navy, &amp;c. [same enumeration as before], shall
    wear a red jack with a Union Jack in a canton at the upper corner
    thereof, next the staff, as aforesaid; and in the other part of the
    said jack, shall be described the seal used in such of the
    respective offices aforesaid, by which the said ships and vessels
    shall be employed. [This flag was the same as Fig. 1, Plate II.,
    except the seal of the office by which employed.] And we do
    strictly charge and command, &amp;c., (and the residue orders, seizure
    of vessels not obeying this proclamation, by wearing other ensigns,
    &amp;c., and to return the names of such ships and vessels, and orders
    strict inquiry into any violation of the proclamation, and then
    directs it to take effect in the Channel or British seas and in the
    North Sea, after twelve days from the date of the proclamation, and
    from the mouth of the Channel unto Cape St. Vincent after six weeks
    from the date, and beyond the cape, and on this side the
    equinoctial line, as well in the ocean and Mediterranean as
    elsewhere, after ten weeks from the date, and beyond the line,
    after the space of eight months from the date of these presents.)

In a description of Boston Harbor, in 1720, thirteen years after the
date of this proclamation, we learn that, "to prevent any possible
surprise from an enemy, there is a light-house built on a rock
appearing above water, about three long leagues from the town, which,
in time of war, makes a signal to the castle, and the castle to the
town, by hoisting and lowering the Union flag so many times as there
are ships approaching."<a href="#note39" name="noteref39" class="fnanchor"><small>[39]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
After having given the first article of the treaty, and the above
proclamation, this description is only useful as proving that the term
"Union Flag" was the familiar one applied to describe the flags
established under the union, as well in the colonies as the mother
country, and explains the following note in Frothingham's <i>Siege of
Boston</i>.
</p>

<p>
Frothingham says: "In 1774, there are frequent notices of Union flags
in the newspapers, but I have not met with any description of the
devices on them."<a href="#note40" name="noteref40" class="fnanchor"><small>[40]</small></a> After the history of Union flags already given,
this will not appear surprising; for who, in our day, speaking of the
"Stars and Stripes," would pause to describe its devices. We, however,
are inclined to the opinion that the flags spoken of in the newspapers,
referred to by Mr. Frothingham, were the ensigns described in the
proclamation of Queen Anne, as being the common ensign of the
commercial marine of "Great Britain, and the dominions thereof." For,
as such, they must have been more easily procurable than the Union
Jacks, and more familiar to the people, and therefore would appeal with
most force to the popular sentiment.
</p>

<p>
That this was the case in the colony of New York, we learn from the
following: "In March, 1775, 'a Union flag with a red field' was hoisted
at New York upon the liberty-pole, bearing the inscription 'George Rex,
and the Liberties of America,' and, upon the reverse, 'No Popery.'"<a href="#note41" name="noteref41" class="fnanchor"><small>[41]</small></a>
With the exception of the mottoes, this was the same flag as is
represented, Fig. 7, Plate I.
</p>

<p>
Frothingham gives us to understand that they were displayed on
liberty-poles and on the famous "Liberty Tree" on Boston Common. In
this connection, we will quote a few lines from a letter, dated
Philadelphia, December 27, 1775, to show the temper of the public mind
at that time, and to indicate the name given to the colonies, whose
flag we are now about to consider.

    "TO THE PEOPLE OF NORTH AMERICA:
</p>

<p class="ralign">
    "<span class="sc">Philadelphia</span>, December 27, 1775.
</p>

<p>
    "Those who have the general welfare of the United English Colonies
    in North America sincerely at heart, who wish to see peace
    restored, and her liberties established on a solid foundation, may,
    at present, be divided into two classes, viz.: those who 'look
    forward to an independency as the only state in which they can
    perceive any security for our liberties and privileges,' and those
    who 'think it not impossible that Britain and America may yet be
    united.'
</p>

<p>
    "If the present struggle should end in the total independence of
    America, which is not impossible, every one will acknowledge the
    necessity of framing what may be called the 'Constitution of the
    United English Colonies.' If, on the other hand, it should
    terminate in a reunion with Great Britain, there yet appears so
    evident a necessity of such a constitution that every good man must
    desire it."<a href="#note42" name="noteref42" class="fnanchor"><small>[42]</small></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
This letter shows the importance the Union of the Colonies, lately
entered into, held in the mind of the public. Prior to its being
entered into, its necessity was thus forcibly indicated to the public
mind. The newspapers commonly bore the device of a disjointed snake,
represented as divided into thirteen portions. Each portion bearing the
initials of one of the colonies, and under it the motto, "Join, or
die." Thus impressed, we can readily perceive how naturally they seized
upon the flag in use in the mother country and its dominions, as an
emblem of union among the members of that mother country, to indicate
the necessity of it among the colonies, and, by displaying it from
liberty-poles, &amp;c., indicated the object for which union was necessary,
viz.: to secure the liberty of British subjects.
</p>

<p>
The first authentic account of the display of the Union flag, as the
flag of the united colonies, is from the pen of General Washington, in
a letter addressed to Colonel Joseph Reed, his military secretary.

    said (and we ought to have believed and acted accordingly), we now
    know the ultimatum of British justice. The speech I send you. A
    volume of them was sent out by the Boston gentry; and, farcical
    enough, we gave great joy to them, without knowing or intending it;
    for, on that day, the day which gave being to the new army, but
    before the proclamation came to hand, we had hoisted the Union flag
    in compliment to the united colonies. But, behold! it was received
    in Boston as a token of the deep impression the speech had made
    upon us, and as a signal of submission. So we hear, by a person out
    of Boston, last night. By this time, I presume, they begin to think
    it strange that we have not made a formal surrender of our lives."
</p>
</div>
<p>
[From <i>Philadelphia Gazette</i>], note to the above, in <i>American
Archives</i>.
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ralign">
    "<span class="sc">Philadelphia</span>, January 15, 1776.
</p>

<p>
    "Our advices conclude with the following anecdote: That, upon the
    king's speech arriving at Boston, a great number of them were
    reprinted and sent out to our lines on the 2d of January, which,
    being also the day of forming the new army, The Great Union Flag
    was hoisted on Prospect Hill, in compliment to the United Colonies.
    This happening soon after the speeches were delivered at Roxbury,
    but before they were received at Cambridge, the Boston gentry
    supposed it to be a token of the deep impression the speech had
    made, and a signal of submission. That they were much disappointed
    at finding several days elapse without some formal measure leading
    to a surrender, with which they had begun to flatter themselves."
</p>
</div>
<p>
We observe, in General Washington's letter, that the Americans,
"farcical enough," "without knowing or intending it," led the Boston
gentry to imagine them about to surrender, because a Union flag was
displayed, which was only displayed in compliment to the United
Colonies on the day the army, organized under the orders of Congress,
<i>subsequent</i> to the union of the thirteen colonies, came into
being. And, in the extract from the newspaper account of this, that the
flag was displayed on Prospect Hill, and that it must have been a
peculiarly marked Union flag, to be called The Great Union Flag. As
this was the name given to the national banner of Great Britain, this
indicates this flag as the national banner of the United Colonies.
Lieutenant Carter, a British officer, very naturally explains both
these circumstances. He was on Charlestown Heights, and says: January
26, 1776: "The king's speech was sent by a flag to them on the 1st
inst. In a short time after they received it, they hoisted an Union
flag (above the continental with thirteen stripes) at Mount Pisgah;
their citadel fired thirteen guns, and gave the like number of
cheers."<a href="#note43" name="noteref43" class="fnanchor"><small>[43]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
This account of the flag, from Lieut. Carter, is corroborated by the
following from the captain of an English transport, to his owners in
London, when taken in connection with the extract subjoined to it,
taken from the <i>British Annual Register</i> for 1776. The captain
writes:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ralign">
    "<span class="sc">Boston</span>, Jan. 17, 1776.
</p>

<p>
    "I can see the rebels' camp very plain, whose colors, a little
    while ago, were entirely red; but, on the receipt of the king's
    speech (which they burnt), they have hoisted the Union Flag, which
    is here supposed to intimate the union of the provinces."<a href="#note44" name="noteref44" class="fnanchor"><small>[44]</small></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>Annual Register</i> says: "The arrival of a copy of the king's
speech, with an account of the fate of the petition from the
Continental Congress, is said to have excited the greatest degree of
rage and indignation among them; as a proof of which, the former was
publicly burnt in the camp; and they are said, on this occasion, to
have changed their colors from a plain red ground, which they had
hitherto used, to a flag with thirteen stripes, as a symbol of the
number and union of the colonies."<a href="#note45" name="noteref45" class="fnanchor"><small>[45]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
We have already shown that the first flag spoken of in both the above
accounts (Flag No. 3) in our Table, bore certain mottoes; and not being
precise in the description of the flag, which for months had been
displayed before their eyes, we may expect inaccuracies in the
description of a flag newly presented to them, and which, even to an
officer on Charlestown Heights, who, as appears, was at some pains to
describe it, appeared to be <i>two</i> flags; and remembering that this
flag was supposed to be displayed on the receipt of the king's speech,
the following account of the colors of British regiments explains why
it was especially regarded by the British as a token of submission.
</p>

<p>
"The kings, or <i>first</i> color of every regiment, is to be the Great
Union throughout.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>second</i> color is to be the color of the facing of the
regiment, with the Union in the upper canton, except those regiments
which are faced with red, white, or black.
</p>

<p>
"The first standard, Guidon, or color of regiments of the line, is not
to be carried by any guard but that of the King, Queen, Prince of
Wales, Commander-in-chief, or Admiral of the Fleet, being of the royal
family; and, except in those cases, it is always to remain with the
regiment."<a href="#note46" name="noteref46" class="fnanchor"><small>[46]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
From the above we see that, to the mind of a British officer, the Union
flag, supposed to have been displayed in connection with the receipt of
the king's speech, above a flag with thirteen stripes, would indicate
an acknowledgment of the supremacy of the king over the United
Colonies, supposed to be represented in the thirteen stripes.
</p>

<p>
Without further proof, therefore, we may conclude that the "Union"
flag, displayed by General Washington, was the union of the crosses of
St. George and St. Andrew, with thirteen stripes through the field of
the flag. (See Fig. 2, Plate II.)
</p>

<p>
On the evacuation of Boston by the British, this standard was, on the
entrance of the American army into Boston, carried by Ensign
Richards.<a href="#note47" name="noteref47" class="fnanchor"><small>[47]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
While we may fairly infer from General Washington's letter, that this
emblem of union had presented itself to his mind as such, we may also
infer from his not describing its accompanying devices, to mark the
compliment to the United Colonies, that he supposed Colonel Joseph
Reed, his military secretary, fully acquainted with them; and from this
we may conclude Colonel Reed had something to do with its preparation.
This conclusion is strengthened by the fact, that Colonel Joseph Reed
was Secretary to the Committee of Conference sent by Congress to
arrange with General Washington the details of the organization of the
army, which went into being January 2, 1776. And, at the very time that
Committee was in session at the camp at Cambridge, we find Colonel Reed
having the subject of flags under consideration. To the reply to a
letter written by him at that time, we may possibly trace the origin of
the use of a modification of the British ensign, a drawing of which is
given under Queen Anne's proclamation before quoted, as the flag of the
United Colonies. And we shall give good reasons to conclude that this
modification consisted in applying to its red field a sufficient number
of white stripes, to divide the whole into thirteen stripes, alternate
red and white, as above shown; and we will show the propriety of this
by establishing the fact that a <i>stripe</i> was the badge of rank in
the ununiformed army that assembled about Boston in defence of liberty.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Joseph Reed, Secretary to the Committee of Conference from
Congress, and Military Secretary of General Washington, the Committee
being then in session, wrote, October 20, 1776: "Please fix upon some
particular color for a flag and a signal by which our vessels may know
one another.<a href="#note48" name="noteref48" class="fnanchor"><small>[48]</small></a> What do you think of a flag with a white ground, a tree
in the middle, the motto, 'Appeal to Heaven?' This is the flag of our
floating batteries." To which Colonels Glover and Moylan replied,
October 21, 1775: "That as Broughton and Selman, who sailed that
morning, had none but their old colors, they had appointed the signal
by which they could be known by their friends to be 'the ensign up to
the maintopping lift."<a href="#note49" name="noteref49" class="fnanchor"><small>[49]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
This ensign, which is called their "old colors," must have been the
ensign spoken of and described in Queen Anne's proclamation. (See Fig.
7, Plate I.) Since we have seen <i>one</i> ensign prescribed 1707, for
the merchant ships and vessels of Great Britain, and the dominions
thereunto belonging, and that no change was made until 1801. This being
the case, the ensign of the colonial cruisers, inasmuch as they were
armed merchant vessels, must have been the British ensign displayed at
the maintopping lift. There were several reasons for this; the most
forcible of which were, that it being usual to have no special place
for the display of the national ensign at sea, but the custom being to
exhibit it in such part of the vessel from which it could be most
conveniently observed by the strange sail (on which occasion only it
was worn at sea), to adopt a particular place for its display would be
to give it a new character; one peculiarly happy for the then state of
affairs, as it would betray the <i>English</i> transports to the
colonial cruisers, and would not betray the <i>Colonial</i> cruisers to
the British ships of war, as "the maintopping lift" must have been such
a position as would not attract the attention of those not in the
secret. This reply of the gentlemen charged with the continental or
colonial cruisers, would readily have suggested a modification of the
British ensign for the ensign of the United Colonies of North America;
for the transition, in the adoption of a flag, from a particular place
for the display of a particular flag, to some modification of the same
flag, was both natural and easy; especially, as a slight modification
of this flag would enable them to indicate the number of colonies,
while the emblem of union would happily indicate the union of those
colonies, and at the same time would have justified them in saying, in
their address of December 6, 1775, "Allegiance to our king. Our words
have ever avowed it, our conduct has ever been in keeping with it," as
having acknowledged their dependence on the mother country, even in the
flag with which they were to struggle against her.
</p>

<p>
Before we proceed to consider the origin of the stripes, we shall give
an account of the same flag as displayed on the fleet fitted out at
Philadelphia about this time, so as to fix, beyond a doubt, this emblem
of <i>union</i>. As a preliminary, we will give a short extract of the
sailing orders given to Benedict Arnold's fleet,<a href="#note50" name="noteref50" class="fnanchor"><small>[50]</small></a> when he set out on
his expedition to Canada. They may be found at length in Major Meigs's
journal of that expedition.
</p>

<p>
"1st Signal." "For speaking with the whole fleet, <i>ensign</i> at
maintopmast head."
</p>

<p>
"2d Signal." "For chasing a sail, ensign at foretopmast head."
</p>

<p>
"6th Signal." "For boarding any vessel, Jack at maintopmast head, and
the whole fleet to draw up in a line as near as possible."
</p>

<p>
The Jack, or Union, or Union Jack, as it was and is called, was and is,
to this day, in the navy of Great Britain, the flag of the admiral of
the fleet; and was probably, as such, worn by the vessel of the
commander-in-chief of this expedition, and its use probably suggested
the adoption of a standard for the commander-in-chief of the first
American fleet, Flag No. 7, in our table. The date of sailing of the
above fleet was Sept. 19, 1775, before the letter of Colonels Glover
and Moylan, speaking of the "old colors," was written (the date of the
latter was Oct. 21, 1775), and the use of the terms jack and ensign
strengthens the conclusion that the term "old colors" meant British
colors, for we shall find, in the orders of the first American fleet,
that the ensign and jack are called the striped ensign and Jack.
</p>

<p>
In this connection, we give a few extracts from the sailing orders of
the first American fleet, "given the several captains in the fleet, at
sailing from the Capes of Delaware, Feb. 17, 1776."<a href="#note51" name="noteref51" class="fnanchor"><small>[51]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
"Sir: You are hereby ordered to keep company with me, if possible, and
truly observe the signals given by the ship I am in."
</p>

<p>
"In case you are in any very great danger of being taken, you are to
destroy these orders and your signals."
</p>

<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ctr">
SIGNALS FOR THE AMERICAN FLEET BY DAY.
</p>

<p>
"For chasing: For the whole fleet to chase, a red pennant at the
foretopmast head." We have already said that, since the time of the
Romans, a red flag has been the signal to prepare for battle.
</p>

<p>
"For seeing a strange vessel: Hoist the ensign, and lower and hoist it
as many times as you see vessels, allowing two minutes between each
time."
</p>

<p>
Supposing this <i>ensign</i> to be a Union flag, observe the similarity
between this signal and that for the lighthouse and castle in Boston
Harbor in 1720; "the lighthouse," as we have already stated, "in time
of war makes a signal to the castle, and the castle to the town, by
hoisting and lowering the Union flag so many times as there are ships
approaching."
</p>

<p>
"For the Providence to chase: A St. George's ensign with stripes at the
mizzen peak."
</p>

<p>
"For a general attack, or the whole fleet to engage, the standard at
the maintopmast head, with the <i>striped</i> Jack and ensign at their
proper places."

harmonizes all of them. We therefore proceed to consider the other and
what may be called the distinctive devices&mdash;we mean the stripes on this
Continental Union Flag.
</p>

<p>
Under the head of Ensign (<i>Brande's Dictionary</i>), we are told:
"Men of war carry a red, white, or blue ensign, according to the color
of the flag of the admiral." By the 1st Article of the union between
England and Scotland, we have seen that the ensigns, both "at sea and
land," were to embody the union of the crosses of St. George and St.
Andrew conjoined; hence the colors, red, white, &amp;c., only apply to the
field of the ensign.
</p>

<p>
In the extract from the King's Regulations for the British Army, we
have shown that the ensign of the different regiments differed in color
according as the facings of the uniforms of the particular regiments to
which they belonged differed. We have seen, in the Crusades, the
different nations were distinguished by different colored crosses on
their surcoats, from which the particular colored cross was transferred
to the national banners of at least Scotland and England. Here the
striking distinction was color. The same practice prevailed at the time
of the Revolution in the colonies.&mdash;See the Proceedings of the
Provincial Congress of Connecticut, "July 1, 1775. One standard for
each regiment, distinguished by their color, as follows, viz.: For the
seventh, blue; for the eighth, orange."<a href="#note54" name="noteref54" class="fnanchor"><small>[54]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
With this practice of nations, then, before them, and evidently applied
by them, viz.: that of applying some badge of distinction in use in
their armies to their national banner, combined with that of indicating
different portions of their armies by different colors for their flags;
and of two nations, when uniting, adopting as a common ensign something
to indicate their union, and still preserve the original banners (both
as to devices and color), under which they had respectively achieved
signal triumphs, especially as this last example was that of the mother
country, we may expect to see the colonies carrying out this practice
in their Union flag.
</p>

<p>
They were British colonies: and, as we have shown, they used the
British Union, but now, they were to distinguish their flag by its
color from other British ensigns, preserve a trace of the colors under
which they had previously fought with success, and, at the same time,
represent this combination in some form peculiar to themselves.
</p>

<p>
The mode of distinction by color could not well be applied by the
United Colonies in a single color, as the simpler and most striking
were exhausted in application to British ensigns; but, if applied, must
have been used in a complex form or combination of colors. This being
the case, stripes of color would naturally be suggested as being
striking, as enabling them to show the number and union of the
colonies, <i>as preserving the colors of the flags previously used by
them</i>; and also the badge of distinction, which, at the time of the
adoption of this flag, marked the different grades in the ununiformed
army before Boston. Hence, probably, the name, <i>The Great Union
Flag</i>, given to it by the writer in the <i>Philadelphia Gazette</i>,
before quoted, doubtless Colonel Joseph Reed, inasmuch as this flag
indicated, as respected the Colonies, precisely what the Great Union
Flag of Great Britain indicated respecting the mother country.
</p>

<p>
The only point that now remains for us to establish is, that a stripe
or ribbon was the badge in common use in the army of the colonists
before Boston. In proof of this, we quote the following extracts from
the orders of General Washington.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">

    persons of the generals as the private men), before they can pass

    officers and their aides-de-camp will be distinguished in the
    following manner: The commander-in-chief, by a light blue ribbon
    worn across his breast, between his coat and waistcoat; the majors
    and brigadiers general by a pink ribbon worn in like manner; the
    aides-de-camp, by a green ribbon."<a href="#note55" name="noteref55" class="fnanchor"><small>[55]</small></a>

    desired that some badges of distinction may be immediately
    provided; for instance, the field officers may have red or pink
    colored cockades in their hats, the captains yellow or buff, and
    the subalterns green. They are to furnish themselves accordingly.
    The sergeants may be distinguished by an epaulette or stripe of red
    cloth sewed upon the right shoulder, the corporals by one of
    green."<a href="#note56" name="noteref56" class="fnanchor"><small>[56]</small></a>

    will wear a broad purple ribbon."
</p>

<p>
    Having thus established the use of the stripe as a badge of
    distinction, we have completed our proofs in reference to the Union
    flag displayed by General Washington before Boston, January 2,
    1776. And to perceive how simple and natural is the deduction of
    the ensign of the army and fleet of the United English Colonies of
    North America, from the national ensign of Great Britain, it is
    only necessary to compare Fig. 7, Plate I. and Fig. 2, Plate II.
</p>

<p>
    Having made some observations in reference to the mottoes on
    several of the flags given in our table, we would now invite
    attention to the religious character of those on the colonial
    flags, viz.: <i>Qui transtulit sustinet</i>, and an "Appeal to
    Heaven." In the famous effort of colonial vigor, which, resulting
    in the capture of Louisburg, surprised the world in 1745, we learn,
    from Belknap's <i>History of New Hampshire</i>, vol ii. p. 157,
    that the flag used bore the motto, <i>Nil desperandum Christo
    Duce</i>. A motto furnished by the celebrated George Whitfield.
    This last flag, under the treaty of union, must have been an Union
    flag, probably, similar to the British ensign above given, or
    perhaps with a white field, to which color the New England people
    were partial (see the colors of the Massachusetts cruisers, Flag
    No. 8, in our table), with the motto above given inscribed on the
    field.
</p>

<p>
    May we not conclude that, when the flags embodying such mottoes
    were dispensed with, some reference to them would still be
    preserved, as would be the case by preserving in the flag which
    replaced them the colors of the flags laid aside?

THE RATTLESNAKE UNION FLAG.
</p>

<p>
The letter previously quoted, dated New Providence, May 13, 1776, says:
"And their standard, a rattlesnake;" motto&mdash;"Don't tread on me." This
<i>standard</i> is thus described, viz.:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ralign">
    "In <span class="sc">Congress</span>, February 9, 1776.
</p>

<p>
    "Colonel Gadsden presented to the Congress an elegant standard,
    such as is to be used by the Commander-in-chief of the American
    Navy, being a yellow field, with a lively representation of a
    rattlesnake in the middle, in the attitude of going to strike, and
    the words underneath, 'Don't tread on me.'<a href="#note57" name="noteref57" class="fnanchor"><small>[57]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
    "<i>Ordered</i>, That the said standard be carefully preserved and
    suspended in the Congress room."
</p>
</div>

<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Before I proceed, I shall offer one or two remarks on this device of
the rattlesnake, to show that it also, as well as the British crosses,
was an emblem of union, and that it was seized upon as one <i>then</i>
(December, 1775) in use, and familiar.
</p>

<p>
In 1754, in the <i>Philadelphia Gazette</i>, when Benjamin Franklin was
editor of that paper, an article appeared, urging <i>union</i> among
the colonies as a means of insuring safety from attacks of the French.
This article closed with a wood-cut of a snake divided into parts, with
the initials of one colony on each division, and the motto, "Join, or
die," underneath, in capital letters.<a href="#note58" name="noteref58" class="fnanchor"><small>[58]</small></a> (See Fig. 3, Plate II.)
</p>

<p>
When union among the colonies was urged, in 1774-6, as a mode of
securing their liberties, this device, a disjointed snake, divided into
<i>thirteen</i> parts, with the initials of a colony on each division,
and the motto, "Join, or die," was adopted as the head-piece of many of
the newspapers. When the union of the colonies took place, this was
changed, for the head-pieces of the newspapers, into the device adopted
on the standard, viz.: a rattlesnake in the attitude of going to
strike, and into an <i>united</i> snake. (Under both forms of this
device, was the motto, "Don't tread on me.")
</p>

<p>
The seal of the War Department is the only public instrument in use,
exhibiting evidence of the rattlesnake's having played an important
part as a device in the American Revolution. The old seal of 1778, and
the more modern seal now in use, both bear the rattlesnake (with its
rattles as the emblem of union), and a <i>liberty cap</i> in contiguity
with it; the <i>liberty cap</i> enveloped by the body, so that the
opened mouth may defend the <i>rattles</i>, and liberty cap, or
<i>union</i> and liberty, with the motto, "This we'll defend." (See
Fig. 4, Plate II.)
</p>

<p>
The following account of this device, supposed to be from the pen of
Benjamin Franklin, indicates fully why it was adopted, and will be
found in the <i>American Archives</i>, vol. iv. p. 468.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="ralign">
    "<span class="sc">Philadelphia</span>, December 27, 1775.
</p>

<p>
"I observe on one of the drums belonging to the marines now raising,
there was painted a rattlesnake, with this motto under it, 'Don't tread
on me.' As I know it is the custom to have some device on the arms of
every country, I suppose this may have been intended for the arms of
America; and, as I have nothing to do with public affairs, and as my
time is perfectly my own, in order to divert an idle hour, I sat down
to guess what could have been intended by this uncommon device. I took
care, however, to consult, on this occasion, a person who is acquainted
with heraldry, from whom I learned that it is a rule, among the learned
in that science, 'that the worthy properties of the animal, in the
crest-born, shall be considered;' he likewise informed me that the
ancients considered the serpent as an emblem of wisdom; and, in a
certain attitude, of endless duration&mdash;both which circumstances, I
suppose, may have been had in view. Having gained this intelligence,
and recollecting that countries 'are sometimes represented by animals
peculiar to them,' it occurred to me that the rattlesnake is found in
no other quarter of the world beside America, and may, therefore, have
been chosen on that account to represent her.
</p>

<p>
"But then, 'the worthy properties' of a snake, I judged, would be hard
to point out. This rather raised than suppressed my curiosity, and
having frequently seen the rattlesnake, I ran over in my mind every
property by which she was distinguished, not only from other animals,
but from those of the same genus or class of animals, endeavoring to
fix some meaning to each, not wholly inconsistent with common sense.
</p>

<p>
"I recollected that her eye excelled in brightness that of any other
animal, and that she has no eye-lids. She may, therefore, be esteemed
an emblem of vigilance. She never begins an attack, nor, when once
engaged, ever surrenders. She is, therefore, an emblem of magnanimity
and true courage. As if anxious to prevent all pretensions of
quarrelling with her, the weapons with which nature has furnished her
she conceals in the roof of her mouth; so that, to those who are
unacquainted with her, she appears to be a defenceless animal; and even
when those weapons are shown and extended for defence, they appear weak
and contemptible; but their wounds, however small, are decisive and
fatal. Conscious of this, she never wounds till she has generously
given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger
of treading on her. Was I wrong sir, in thinking this a strong picture
of the temper and conduct of America?
</p>

<p>
"The poison of her teeth is the necessary means of digesting her food,
and at the same time is certain destruction to her enemies. This may be
understood to intimate that those things which are destructive to our
enemies, may be to us not only harmless, but absolutely necessary to
our existence. I confess I was wholly at a loss what to make of the
rattles, till I went back and counted them; and found them just
thirteen, exactly the number of the colonies united in America; and I
recollected, too, that this was the only part of the snake which
increased in number.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it might be only fancy, but I conceited the painter had shown
a half-formed additional rattle; which, I suppose, may have been
intended to represent the province of Canada. 'Tis curious and amazing
to observe how distinct and independent of each other the rattles of
this animal are, and yet how firmly they are united together, so as
never to be separated but by breaking them to pieces. One of these
rattles singly is incapable of producing sound; but the ringing of
thirteen together is sufficient to alarm the boldest man living. The
rattlesnake is solitary, and associates with her kind only, when it is
necessary for their preservation. In winter, the warmth of a number
together will preserve their lives: while, singly, they would probably
perish. The power of fascination attributed to her, by a generous
construction, may be understood to mean, that those who consider the
liberty and blessings which America affords, and once come over to her,
never afterwards leave her, but spend their lives with her. She
strongly resembles America in this, that she is beautiful in her youth,
and her beauty increaseth with her age, 'her tongue also is blue, and
forked as the lightning, and her abode is among impenetrable rocks.'
</p>

<p>
"Having pleased myself with reflections of this kind, I communicated my
sentiments to a neighbor of mine, who has a surprising readiness at
guessing at everything which relates to public affairs; and indeed, I
should be jealous of his reputation in that way, was it not that the
event constantly shows that he has guessed wrong. He instantly declared
it as his sentiments, that the Congress meant to allude to Lord North's
declaration in the House of Commons, that he never would relax his
measures until he had brought America to his feet; and to intimate to
his lordship, that if she was brought to his feet, it would be
dangerous treading on her. But, I am positive he has guessed wrong, for
I am sure that Congress would not condescend, at this time of day, to
take the least notice of his lordship, in that or any other way. In
which opinion, I am determined to remain, your humble servant."
</p>
</div>
<p>
The yellow flag, with the rattlesnake in the middle, and the words
underneath, "Don't tread on me," (see Fig. 5, Plate II.,) the standard
for the Commander-in-chief of the American Navy, was probably the flag
referred to by Paul Jones, in his journal.
</p>

<p>
Paul Jones was commissioned first of the first lieutenants in the
continental navy. "This commission, under the United Colonies, is dated
the 7th of December, 1775, as first lieutenant of the Alfred. On board
that ship, before Philadelphia, Mr. Jones hoisted the flag of America,
with his own hands, the first time it was ever displayed, as the
commander-in-chief embarked on board the Alfred." (Page 34, <i>Life and
Correspondence of Paul Jones</i>.)
</p>

<p>
From the foregoing account, it will be perceived that the first flag
adopted by the army of the colonists before Boston, was a red flag,
with the mottoes, <i>Qui transtulit sustinet</i>, and "An Appeal to
Heaven." By the combination of these mottoes, the union of
Massachusetts and Connecticut, in defence of their outraged liberties,
was doubtless intimated; and, taken in connection with those mottoes,
the color of the flag indicated that, trusting in the God of battles,
they defied the power of the mother country. About this time, too, the
floating batteries, the germ of the navy subsequently organized, bore a
white flag, with a green pine-tree, and the motto, "Appeal to Heaven."
These flags were adopted before the union of the <i>thirteen</i>
colonies was effected.
</p>

<p>
After that union, and upon the organization of the army and fleet,
these flags were supplanted by one calculated to show to the world the
union of the North American colonies among themselves, and as an
integral part of the British Empire, and as such demanding the rights
and liberties of British subjects. And a flag combining the crosses of
St. George and St. Andrew united (the distinctive emblem of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain), with a field composed of thirteen stripes,
alternate red and white, the combination of the flags previously used
in the camp, on the cruisers, and the floating batteries of the
colonies, was adopted for this purpose, and called <span class="sc">The Great Union
Flag</span>.
</p>

<p>
The union implied both the union of the colonies represented in the
striped field, which was dependent upon it, and the nationality of
those colonies. The thirteen stripes, alternate red and white,
constituting the field of the flag, represented the body of that union,
the number of the members which composed it, as well as the union of
the flags, which had preceded this Great Union Flag.
</p>

<p>
We assume that the colors of those stripes were alternate red and
white, inasmuch as those were the colors in the first flag of the
United States, and we presume no change, not absolutely necessary, was
made, in altering the flag of the United Colonies to that of the United
States. There is no evidence of their being of that color, except the
universally received tradition that such was the case.
</p>

<p>
The colors of those stripes, alternate red and white, indicated on the
part of the colonies, thus represented as united, the defiance to
oppression, symbolized by the red color of the flag of the army, and
red field of the flag of the continental cruisers together, with the
purity implied by the white flag of the floating batteries, of which
the motto was, "Appeal to Heaven."
</p>

<p>
Lest these conclusions should seem far fetched, we would again advert
to the fact, that in the present Union, or national flag of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, not only are the crosses of St.
George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick united, but the colors of the
fields of the banners of St. George, of England, St. Andrew, of
Scotland, and St. Patrick, of Ireland, are preserved.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the colonies, everything that tended to call to mind
previous triumphs would have been studiously preserved, and the red and
white flags were identified with the successes of Bunker Hill, (for
tradition says the flag on that occasion was red, and that a Whig told
General Gage that the motto was, "Come, if you dare,")<a href="#note59" name="noteref59" class="fnanchor"><small>[59]</small></a> and the
various successes of the siege of Boston, prior to Jan. 2, 1776.
</p>

<p>
The use of the stripes, besides indicating the union of the above
flags, for the purpose before indicated, would, as a badge of
distinction for the Great Union Flag of the colonies, have carried the
minds of those who were marshalled under it back to the moment when the
tocsin of war sounded at Lexington&mdash;called them, "generals" as well as
"private men,"&mdash;in the garbs in which they were pursuing their peaceful
avocations, to arms in defence of liberty. And we of the present day
should regard them as hallowed, by having been employed by General
Washington as the first step towards introducing subordination into the
army, which achieved our independence. In those stripes we may perceive
the necessity indicated of the subordination of each State to the
Union, while their equality under the Union is also intimated, by there
being nothing to indicate that any particular State was represented by
any particular stripe. There being seven red stripes, doubtless arose
from that being the color of the principal flags represented in the
combination of colors, for certainly the flags of the army and cruisers
must have had pre-eminence over that of the floating batteries.
</p>

<p>
The striped Union flag was the colonial colors, both at sea and land,
but there was also, as we have seen, a standard such as was used by the
commander-in-chief of the American navy, being a yellow field, with a
lively representation of a rattlesnake in the middle, in the attitude
of going to strike, and the words underneath, "Don't tread on me." The
color of the snake, as represented, was dark. This circumstance goes
strongly to prove the correctness of our conclusion, that the example
of the mother country was followed in the preparation of the flags of
this period&mdash;for the quarantine flag of the mother country was a
<i>yellow</i> flag with a dark spot, a representation of the
plague-spot in the middle&mdash;those colors were, doubtless, chosen for the
rattlesnake flag, to indicate the deadly character of the venom of the
rattlesnake, and the danger of treading on it.
</p>

<p>
But we have before stated that the rattlesnake first appeared as a
snake divided into thirteen parts, each part marked with the initials
of the colony to which it corresponded, and beneath them the motto,
"Join, or die," indicating the necessity of union. And that, the union
being effected, the initials on the parts were dropped (thus indicating
the equality of the colonies under the Union), and the parts were
united in the form indicated in this standard, and beneath it the
words, "Don't tread on me," implying the consciousness of strength
derived from that union, of which, we have seen, the rattlesnake was an
emblem indigenous to America, while at the same time the serpent
implies eternal duration. This, then, may properly be called the
Rattlesnake Union Standard, and the other, the Great Union, or Striped
Union Flag; and together they indicated that existence as a people was
inseparable from union&mdash;the strength resulting from that union&mdash;the
necessary subordination of each colony to the whole Union, the intimate
connection of the colonies composing the Union, their equality and
perpetuity under it, and the power of fascination in the Union and
harmony in the colonies, which would draw everybody to America, and
cause those who had once tasted the liberty and blessings she enjoys,
never to leave her, but to "spend their lives with her."
</p>

<p>
Having thus described the flags of the United Colonies, and shown that
they were emblematic of union, and hence called Union flags, in
imitation of the prevailing custom of the mother country, we now
proceed to consider the Flag of the United States, described in the
following Resolution of Congress, passed June 14, 1777:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"<i>Resolved</i>, That the Flag of the Thirteen United States be
thirteen stripes, alternate red and white: That the union be thirteen
stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation."
</p></div>

<p>
This resolution was made public September 3, 1777; and Colonel Trumbull
represents the flag made in pursuance of it as used at Burgoyne's
surrender, October 17, 1777.
</p>

<p>
From the above resolution and what has preceded, it is apparent that
the object of that resolution was simply to give the authorization of
Congress to a color existing, so far as the stripes and part of the
flag called the union were concerned; but it is worthy of remark that
the character of the new emblem for that union is specially described
as representing "a new constellation."
</p>

<p>
The use of some emblem of union different from the British crosses, the
United States having declared themselves free and independent States,
was eminently natural, but the description of the emblem substituted
for them as "representing a new constellation," involves the idea that
some constellation, in some way emblematic of union, had been presented
to the minds of those adopting this resolution. It may be said that the
adoption of a star, as the representative of a State, would naturally
lead to the idea of a constellation; but, as the emblem to be altered
was one of union, we are inclined to think that the first idea
suggested was that of some constellation, which of itself implied
union, and that the representation of a State by a star was involved in
it.
</p>

<p>
The question that now arises is, was there any constellation which
implied union? The answer is, there was the constellation Lyra. The
next point is, to ascertain if the first flag displayed under this
resolution bore that constellation. If not, in what form the stars were
presented on that flag, and whether any connection can be traced
between it and the constellation Lyra.
</p>

<p>
Let us first consider the fitness of the constellation Lyra to indicate
union. In Charles Anthon's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Antiquities</i>, we find the following account of the Lyra. He says:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Lyra. The Latin name <i>fides</i>, which was used for a lyre as well
as a cithara, is probably the same as the Greek &sigma;&phi;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;,
which, according to Hesychius, signifies gut-strings; but Festus takes
it to be the same as <i>fides</i> (faith), <i>because the lyre was the
symbol of harmony and unity among men</i>." The quotation from the
Astronomicon of Manilius, presented in the following letter from Mr.
Charles Francis Adams, grandson of Mr. John Adams, confirms the
attributes above ascribed to the lyre, and its corresponding
constellation "Lyra."

    record of the action of the body, nor of any further history of it
    than is given in his lately published diary. I am, therefore,
    wholly unable to give you any light upon the question of the origin
    of the American colors.
</p>

<p>
    With regard to the other design, of the eagle, with the lyre on its
    breast, and the stars of the constellation Lyra, I can only say
    that I possess the seal which was the original form in which the
    device was presented. There it has the motto, <i>Nunc sidera
    ducit</i>, taken from the Astronomicon of Manilius, describing the
    effect of the Lyre of Orpheus,
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p>
        "At Lyra diductis per c&oelig;lum cornibus inter Sidera

    It is my opinion that, although this last line does not appear, my
    father had it in his mind when applying the device to the American
    passport, but I have not had the leisure to look for any
    explanation he may have himself left of it. His papers are
    voluminous, and I have barely as yet glanced at any part of their
    contents. This must be my apology for sending you so unsatisfactory
    a reply.

<p>
The following is a translation of the above quotation:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Conspicuous among the stars, its horns wide spread over the heavens, is
the Lyre, with which Orpheus was wont to captivate everything to which
he addressed his song, and even made a journey through Hades itself,
and put to sleep the infernal laws. Hence, its celestial honor; and, by
the same power with which it then drew rocks and trees along, it now
leads the stars, and <i>whirls along the immense orb of the revolving
world</i>.
</p>

<p>
This last line shows that the constellation Lyra, as an emblem of union
for the United States, would have been an amplification of the
attribute of "fascination" ascribed to the Rattlesnake, as an emblem of
union for the United States, in the account we have already given of
the Rattlesnake as such, in describing the standard of the
commander-in-chief of the American navy; for the constellation Lyra
would not only imply "that those who consider the liberty and blessings
which America affords, and once come over to her, never afterwards
leave her, but spend their lives with her," but that by their union and
harmony the United States would "whirl along the immense orb of the
revolving world," to follow their example in their forms of government.
</p>

<p>
Having thus shown how appropriate the constellation Lyra would have
been as an emblem of the union of the United States, we proceed to
ascertain if the first flag displayed under the resolution of June 14,
1777, bore that constellation. In Trumbull's picture of the surrender
of Burgoyne, and Peale's picture of Washington, the thirteen stars are
represented as arranged in a circle; it now remains to show the
existence of some record exhibiting a connection between the
constellation Lyra and the circle of thirteen stars.
</p>

<p>
We find this record on a form for a passport of the United States,
prepared under Mr. John Quincy Adams, when Secretary of State, in 1820,
which form is now in use. In adopting the form in question, the arms of
the United States, previously used on U.S. passports, were replaced by
a circle of thirteen stars surrounding an eagle, holding in his beak
the constellation Lyra, and the motto, <i>Nunc sidera ducit</i>.
</p>

<p>
Mr. W. J. Stone, of Washington City, gives the following account of
the preparation of the device above described, and presented in
the vignette to the title-page. In it, the constellation Lyra is
represented as radiating into a circle of thirteen stars.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>
    <span class="sc">My Dear Sir</span>: I find, on examination, that on the 25th of
    August, 1820, I engraved for the Department of State, by order of
    J. Q. Adams, Secretary of State, a plate for a passport, at the
    head of which was a spread eagle, drawn to encompass the
    constellation Lyra.
</p>

<p>
    The drawing was made by me, according to particular verbal
    directions given by Mr. Adams. I have a distinct recollection of
    having submitted the drawing to Mr. Adams, for approval, previous
    to engraving.
</p>

<p>
    Very respectfully, your obedt. servt.

</p>
</div>
<p>
Had not this device been substituted, on the form for a United States
passport, for the arms of the United States, by Mr. John Quincy Adams,
we should not consider the constellation Lyra, radiating into a circle
of thirteen stars, as having any special meaning; but as, at the time
the circle of thirteen stars was introduced into the flag of the United
States as an emblem of union, his father, Mr. John Adams, was chairman
of the Board of War, we think it has.
</p>

<p>
On page 6, vol. iii. of the <i>Life and Writings of John Adams</i>, we
find the following entry in his journal:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"The duties of this Board kept me in continual employment, not to say
drudgery, from the 12th of June 1776, till the 11th of November 1777."
Again: "Other gentlemen attended as they pleased, but, as I was
chairman, or as they were pleased to call it, president, I must never
be absent."
</p></div>

<p>
A change being contemplated in the emblem of union in the flag, the
Board of War would, doubtless, have had charge of the preparation of
the substitute; and from the above, we perceive the chairman must have
been particularly connected with its preparation.
</p>

<p>
We have thus presented the data upon which is based the conclusion that
the constellation Lyra was originally proposed for the union of our
Flag, in 1777, at the time the circle of thirteen stars was adopted.
The reasons for that conclusion are the following:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/003.jpg" alt="Plate III" width="299" height="500"></div>
<p class="caption">Pl. III.
</p>

<p>
It was a Union flag that was to be altered. The United States having
become independent of Great Britain, the British emblem of union was no
longer appropriate; some other emblem of union was to be substituted.
</p>

<p>
The constellation Lyra was a time-honored emblem of union. The language
of the resolution of June 14, 1777, evidently has reference to such an
emblem, representing a constellation. The Lyra was not adopted. A
circle of thirteen stars was. At this time, Mr. John Adams was chairman
of the Board of War.
</p>

<p>
Mr. John Adams's son became Secretary of State in 1820. Striking out
the arms of the United States, he presented on the passport a device,
representing the constellation Lyra radiating into a circle of
stars&mdash;the stars thirteen in number. At this time there were twenty-one
States in the Union&mdash;hence this circle of thirteen stars referred to an
earlier day. The first instance of a circle of thirteen stars being
used as a national device, was in the U. S. Flag, and its being
presented on the passport must have referred to that use of it, as
constituting it a well-known emblem of the United States, indicative of
their union, while the constellation Lyra, occupying the centre of this
circle, indicates the origin of the circle of stars, as an emblem of
union "representing a new constellation," in that time-honored emblem
of union. The other circumstances we have adduced point to Mr. John
Adams as the source from which his son derived his information. We
suppose the circle of stars was preferred to the Lyra because it
indicated the perpetuity of the Union, which was distinctly intimated
by the Rattlesnake Standard, laid aside when the flag of the United
States, commonly called the Stars and Stripes, was adopted. It may not
be improper to observe that these deductions are in keeping with the
general rules, presented in our Introduction, as deduced from the
practices of nations relative to national emblems.
</p>

<p>
Compare Fig. 6, Plate II., the Flag of the United States, as first
presented under the resolution of June 14, 1777, with Fig. 1, Plate
III., the flag as we suppose it to have been proposed when Mr. John
Adams was chairman of the Board of War, and both of the above with the
vignette to the title-page, the device introduced into the passport in
<i>lieu</i> of the arms of the United States, by Mr. John Q. Adams,
when Secretary of State.
</p>

<p>
In making these comparisons, the eagle, only adopted for the arms of
the United States in 1782, must be kept out of view, or rather
considered as having no part in the question about the stars.
</p>

<p>
In the preceding pages, we have established the origin of the part of
the flag called "the union," also that of the circle of stars as an
emblem for that union, together with that of the stripes, as clearly as
analogy will enable us so to do. As corroborating the views we have
advanced, we now present to the reader the reports on the adoption of
the arms of the United States, copied by permission from unpublished
records of the State Department, from which it appears that certain of
those who prepared the devices for the Flag of the United States, were
also engaged in the preparation of the device for a Great Seal.

</p></div>

<p class="space">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
In regard to this Report, we observe Mr. John Adams was one of those
engaged in preparing it. The emblems to represent countries were the
rose for England, the thistle for Scotland, the harp for Ireland, &amp;c.
May not this train of ideas have suggested to his mind the lyre and its
corresponding constellation to mark the Union of the United States of
America in the flag of those States?
</p>

<p>
We observe the reference to the Sacred Volume in the device for the
reverse of the proposed Seal. May not the idea of stars, as the
representatives of dependent States, have been borrowed from the same
source, and applied in the case of the flag as States dependent upon
union, and thus constituting a constellation?

    "The thirteen pieces, barways, which fill up the field of the arms,

    by the confederation of those States. Their disposition in the form
    of a circle, denotes the perpetuity of its continuance, the ring
    being the symbol of eternity. The eagle displayed, is the symbol of
    supreme power and authority, and signifies the Congress; the pillar
    upon which it rests is used as the hieroglyphic of fortitude and
    constancy, and its being of the Doric order (which is the best
    proportioned and most agreeable to nature), and composed of several
    members, or parts, all taken together, forming a beautiful
    composition of strength, congruity, and usefulness, it may, with
    great propriety, signify a well-planned government. The eagle being
    placed on the summit of the column is emblematical of the
    sovereignty of the government of the United States; and as further
    expressive of that idea, those two charges, or five and six azure,
    are borne in a pale which extends across the thirteen pieces into
    which the escutcheon is divided. The signification of the eye has
    been already explained. The helmet is such as appertains to
    sovereignty, and the cap is used as the token of freedom and
    excellency. It was formerly worn by dukes; says Guillien, <i>they
    had a more worthy government than other subjects</i>. The cock is
    distinguished for two most excellent qualities, viz.,
    <i>vigilance</i> and <i>fortitude</i>.

<p>
    "The genius of the American confederated Republic is denoted by the
    blue scarf and fillet glittering with stars, and by the tag of
    Congress which she displays. Her dress is white edged with green,
    colors emblematical of innocence and truth. Her purple girdle and
    radiated crown indicate her sovereignty; the word "Virtue," on the
    former, is to show that that should be her principal ornament; and
    the <i>radiated</i> crown, that no earthly crown shall rule her.
    The dove, on the top of the American standard, denotes the mildness
    and purity of her government.

<p>
Mr. Middleton, Mr. Boudinot, and Mr. Rutledge, reported a modification
of this, June 13, 1782, which was referred to the Secretary of the
United States, in Congress assembled, to take order.
</p>

<p>
Device for a Great Seal, as adopted June 20, 1782.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"The Secretary of the United States in Congress assembled, to whom was
referred the several reports of committees on the device of a Great
Seal to take order, reports:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That the device for an armorial atchievement, and reverse of a Great
Seal for the United States in Congress assembled, is as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<span class="sc">Arms.</span>&mdash;Paleways, of thirteen pieces, argent and gules, a
chief azure. The escutcheon on the breast of the American bald eagle,
displayed proper, holding in his dexter talon an olive-branch, and in
his sinister a bundle of thirteen arrows, all proper, and in his beak a
scroll, inscribed with this motto: <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>.
</p>

<p>
"<span class="sc">For The Crest.</span>&mdash;Over the head of the eagle, which appears
above the escutcheon, a glory, or, breaking through a cloud proper, and
surrounding thirteen stars forming a constellation, argent on an azure
field.
</p>

<p>
"<span class="sc">Reverse.</span>&mdash;A pyramid unfinished. In the zenith, an eye in a
triangle, surrounded with a glory proper. Over the eye these words,
<i>Annuit C&oelig;ptis</i>. On the base of the pyramid, the numerical
letters, MDCCLXXVI., and underneath the following motto:
</p>

<p class="ctr">
    '<i>Novus ordo Seclorum.</i>'
</p>

<p>
"<i>Remarks and Explanations.</i>&mdash;The escutcheon is composed of the
chief and pale, the two most honorable ordinaries. The pieces paly,
represent the several States all joined in one solid compact entire,
supporting a chief, which unites the whole and represents Congress. The
motto, alluding to this Union. The pales in the arms are kept closely
united by the chief, and the chief depends on that union, and the
strength resulting from it, for its support, to denote the confederacy
of the United States of America, and the preservation of their Union
through Congress.
</p>

<p>
"The colors of the pales are those used in the flag of the United
States of America; white, signifies purity and innocence; red,
hardiness and valor; and blue, the color of the chief, signifies
vigilance, perseverance, and justice. The olive-branch and arrows
denote the power of peace and war, which is exclusively vested in
Congress. The constellation denotes a new State taking its place and
rank among the sovereign powers. The escutcheon is borne on the breast
of the American eagle, without any other supporters, to denote that the
United States of America ought to rely on their own virtue.
</p>

<p>
"<span class="sc">Reverse.</span>&mdash;The pyramid signifies strength and duration. The
eye over it, and the motto, allude to the many and signal
interpositions of Providence in favor of the American cause. The date
underneath is that of the Declaration of Independence; and the words
under it signify the beginning of the new American era, which commences
from that date."
</p>
</div>
<p>
In most of the above reports, a reference will be perceived to the
devices and colors of the flag of the U. States, and many of the ideas
presented in them are drawn from it, viz., the chief azure
corresponding to the union of the flag, the pales corresponding to the
stripes, which together constitute a whole; the constellation of stars
also taken from the flag, and indicating a new State (composed of
thirteen States) dependent upon their union. As these are the principal
ideas presented in the arms of the United States, may we not reasonably
conclude that, being borrowed from the flag, they are the views that
prevailed at the time of its adoption, presented under another guise?
The reference to eternity, in the arms, was indicated by the circle of
stars in the flag; the reference to Providence, in the eye, was in the
flag presented in the field of thirteen stripes, a combination of the
red and white flags, which bore the mottoes: "<i>Qui transtulit
sustinet</i>," and an "Appeal to Heaven."
</p>

<p>
It is intimated, in some of these reports, that the colors for the flag
were adopted apart from other reasons, as implying certain virtues; of
the fact of their implying them there can be no doubt, but that they
were not immediately adopted into the flag for that reason, but rather
because they were already in use, with these meanings attached to them,
at least so far as the red and white colors were concerned, we think we
have conclusively shown. We shall presently offer some suggestions
relative to the blue color, which will indicate a more direct reason
for its adoption than the virtues implied by it.
</p>

<p>
But to return to the account of the flag. We remarked, under the head
of the Great Union Flag of the Colonies, that the stripes in the field
of the flag were not only designed to show the union of the thirteen
colonies, but also the number of members which composed it, and their
dependence as a whole upon the Union. The first change in the flag of
the United States, shows that this conclusion was a correct one. It was
directed in the following resolution:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"<i>Be it enacted</i>, &amp;c., That from and after the first day of May,
Anno Domini one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, the flag of the
United States be fifteen stripes, alternate red and white. That the
union be fifteen stars, white in a blue field." Approved January 13,
1794. (See Fig. 2, Plate III.)
</p></div>

<p>
This was the flag of the United States during the war of 1812-14.
</p>

<p>
In 1818, the flag of the United States was again altered, and, as we
are informed, on the suggestion of the Hon. Mr. Wendover, of New York,
a return was made to the thirteen stripes; as it was anticipated the
flag would become unwieldy if a stripe was added on the admission of
each State; and, moreover, by the plan proposed, the union of the old
thirteen States, as well as the number of members composing the
existing Union, would be presented by the flag of the United States.
Mr. W. also proposed the arrangement of the stars in the union into the
form of a single star. In this, there was a departure from the original
design, as the perpetuity of the Union ceased to be indicated by the
flag, as it had previously been in the circle of stars, except so far
as indicated by the several stars forming one large star.
</p>

<p>
The Resolution of 1818 was as follows:-
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"<i>Be it enacted</i>, &amp;c., That from and after the fourth day of July
next, the flag of the United States be thirteen horizontal stripes,
alternate red and white; that the union be twenty stars, white, in a
blue field.
</p>

<p>
"And, that, on the admission of a new State into the Union, one star be
added to the union of the flag; and that such addition shall take
effect on the fourth day of July next succeeding such admission."
Approved April 4, 1818.
</p></div>

<p>
The flag planted on the National Palace of the city of Mexico had
thirty stars in the union.
</p>

<p>
The following compliment was paid to this flag.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
June 3, 1848, "Mr. Drayton submitted the following resolution; which
was considered, by unanimous consent, and agreed to:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Resolved</i>, That the Vice-President be requested to have the flag
of the United States first erected by the American army upon the palace
in the capital of Mexico, and now here presented, deposited for
safe-keeping in the Department of State of the United States."&mdash;Page
370, Journal of the Senate 1847-48.
</p></div>

<p>
The union of the United States flag at present contains thirty-one
stars. (See Fig. 3, Plate III.)
</p>

<p>
We have, in the preceding pages, offered many reasons for concluding
that the devices in the flag, its colors, and the manner in which they
were combined, originated in some circumstance directly connected with
the history of the colonies, or in some practice which prevailed in the
mother country. Particularly was this the case in the adoption of the
emblem of union from the mother country. This leads us to make a few
remarks as to the prominence given to the color blue in the reports on
the adoption of the device for a Great Seal of the United States, and
in its being the ground of the uniform of the United States. We have
previously stated that its adoption was due to other circumstances
directly, than its being typical of the virtues of perseverance,
vigilance, and justice, though indirectly this meaning was involved in
its adoption. First, blue was a favorite color in the colonies, as is
proved by the fact of its being the uniform of the South Carolina
troops in 1775. For we have seen that Colonel Moultrie caused a large
blue flag to be made, with a crescent in one corner, to be uniform with
the troops; and by the fact that the pine-tree flag of New England was
a blue field, containing in the upper canton, next the staff, a St.
George's cross on a white ground, and a pine-tree represented in the
upper square formed by the cross. A reason for this color being a
favorite in New England, may perhaps be found in the circumstance,
that, in 1679, when the banner of the league and covenant was raised in
Scotland, it was a red flag, the borders of which were edged with
blue.<a href="#note63" name="noteref63" class="fnanchor"><small>[63]</small></a> Borders of different color from the body of the flag, or from
the shield of the coat of arms, are in heraldry, a common distinction,
and as such was doubtless applied by the Covenanters (blue being the
color of the field of the banner of Scotland, as we have seen), to
indicate by whom this red flag was raised, and thus the blue color
became identified with the league and covenant. After the defeat of
Bothwell's Bridge, many of those people fled to the colonies,
particularly to New England and New Jersey.
</p>

<p>
That feelings kindred to those excited among the Covenanters were
aroused among the colonists, is shown by the mottoes on "the Union flag
with a red field," already spoken of as displayed on a liberty-pole in
New York city in 1775. Those mottoes were, "No Popery," and "George Rex
and the liberties of America." It was probably in reference to his
being commander of the armies of the colonies, united in a solemn
league and covenant in defence of civil and religious liberty, that
General Washington adopted as his badge a light blue riband, which had
already been identified with a similar league and covenant in Scotland.
At a later day, on the adoption of an Union flag as the flag of the
United Colonies, the color of the field of the union (derived, as was
the blue border of the red flag of the Covenanters, from the banner of
Scotland) being blue, this color became identified with that which gave
nationality to the colonies, viz., their union, and on this account was
adopted as the ground of the national uniform, and as the color for the
chief or union, both in the arms of the United States and in their
flag.
</p>

<p>
That the prevailing colors of the uniforms of the army at that time
corresponded to the colors of the flag, is a well-known fact. Thus the
facings of the blue coats were red, the color of the plumes white,
tipped with red, &amp;c. The buff and blue, commonly regarded as the
continental uniform, was that of the general officers, and not of the
body of the troops. In the navy, the same was the case. The prevailing
colors of the uniform of the officers of the navy were blue and red;
those of the uniform of the marine officers, green and white: the
colors of the flag of the United States, and of the flag of the
floating batteries, before given, viz., white, with a green tree in the
middle, &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
That such considerations operate in the selection of colors for
uniforms, is proved by the fact that the uniform of the United States
corps of cadets, a corps instituted and kept up with a view to foster
and preserve military knowledge in our country, instead of being of the
national color, blue, is gray trimmed with black. This color for the
uniform of that corps was chosen in 1815, out of compliment to the
services of the brigade commanded by General Scott at Chippewa, &amp;c., in
the war of 1812-14. The embargo and the war having cut off the supply
of blue cloths, the commissary-general of purchases was forced
temporarily to supply that brigade with a substitute of gray, trimmed
with black.
</p>

<p>
As this, then, was the origin of the color of the uniform of the corps
of cadets, may we not conclude that, for the reasons assigned, blue was
adopted as our national color, out of compliment to the Union, with
which, as we have shown, it was intimately connected.
</p>

<p>
Having given the preceding account of our National Flag, we now add the
names of those connected with its different phases.
</p>

<p>
1st. General Washington.
</p>

<p>
2d. Benjamin Franklin, Mr. Lynch, and Mr. Harrison; the Committee of
Conference, with General Washington, on the organization of the army,
of which Colonel Joseph Reed was Secretary.
</p>

<p>
3d. The Marine Committee; Mr. Bartlett, Mr. Hancock, Mr. Hopkins, Mr.
Deane, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Crane, Mr. R. Morris, Mr. Read, Mr. Chase, Mr. R.
H. Lee, Mr. Hewes, Mr. Gadsden, and Mr. Houston.
</p>

<p>
4th. The Board of War; Mr. J. Adams, Mr. Sherman, Mr. Harrison, Mr.
Wilson, and Mr. E. Rutledge.
</p>

<p>
With this array of names before us, of those who, with others,
established our liberty and Union, and the idea we have developed, that
the devices adopted by them for the National Ensign of our country were
intended to intimate the perpetuity of that country's union, may we not
truly say of <span class="sc">Washington</span> and his compeers, now resting in their
graves, as connected with those devices, There is neither speech nor
language, but their voices are heard among them. Their sound has gone
out into all lands, and their words into the ends of the world,
proclaiming their trust in Providence, that that Union should only
perish, when the sun and moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall
withdraw their light.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
